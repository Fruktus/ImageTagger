# ImageTagger
---
This is a simple Java program I wrote in order to easily classify images by hand for machine learning purposes.
Currently might be buggy. 

## Features
- Moves or copies images to folders mapped to keyboard shortcuts
- Tracks statistics

## TODO
- Debbuging
- Undo/Redo
- More keyboard shortcuts
- More supported image formats (webp)
